# Posix

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**type** | **str** | The type of storage.  &#x60;type &#x3D; \&quot;posix\&quot;&#x60;  Any POSIX compatible storage, typically attached over high-throughput local network, such as NFS.  | 
**timeout** | **int** | Storage operation timeout in milliseconds. | [optional] 
**skip_storage_detection** | **bool** | If true, detecting whether storage is directly accessible by the Oneclient will not be performed. This option should be set to true on readonly storages.  | [optional] [default to False]
**luma_feed** | **str** | Type of feed for LUMA DB. Feed is a source of user/group mappings used to populate the LUMA DB. For more info please read: https://onedata.org/#/home/documentation/doc/administering_onedata/luma.html  | [optional] [default to 'auto']
**luma_feed_url** | **str** | URL of external feed for LUMA DB. Relevant only if lumaFeed equals &#x60;external&#x60;. | [optional] 
**luma_feed_api_key** | **str** | API key checked by external service used as feed for LUMA DB. Relevant only if lumaFeed equals &#x60;external&#x60;.  | [optional] 
**qos_parameters** | **dict(str, str)** | Map with key-value pairs used for describing storage QoS parameters. | [optional] 
**imported_storage** | **bool** | Defines whether storage contains existing data to be imported.  | [optional] [default to False]
**archive_storage** | **bool** | Defines whether storage supports long-term dataset archiving.  | [optional] [default to False]
**readonly** | **bool** | Defines whether the storage is readonly. If enabled, Oneprovider will block any operation that writes, modifies or deletes data on the storage. Such storage can only be used to import data into the space. Mandatory to ensure proper behaviour if the backend storage is actually configured as readonly. This option is available only for imported storages.  | [optional] [default to False]
**mount_point** | **str** | The absolute path to the directory where the POSIX storage is mounted on the cluster nodes.  | 
**storage_path_type** | **str** | Determines how the logical file paths will be mapped on the storage. &#x27;canonical&#x27; paths reflect the logical file names and directory structure, however each rename operation will require renaming the files on the storage. &#x27;flat&#x27; paths are based on unique file UUID&#x27;s and do not require on-storage rename when logical file name is changed. **Note that &#x27;flat&#x27; paths are not allowed on this type of storage.**  | [optional] [default to 'canonical']
**root_uid** | **int** | UID of the user on whose behalf operations in the admin context will be performed on the storage. | [optional] 
**root_gid** | **int** | GID of the group on whose behalf operations in the admin context will be performed on the storage. | [optional]
